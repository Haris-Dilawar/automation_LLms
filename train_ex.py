             1.	Introduction
             1.1.1.	Contour Town Planning has been asked to provide a planning statement in support of this application to the City of Edinburgh Council (‘the Council’) by Iain Muirhead (‘the applicant’) for a Certificate of Lawfulness of Existing Use or Development (‘CLEUD’) in respect of the use of the subject property (the flat) in his/her ownership at (address here and info change here).
             1.1.2.	The flat has been used as short term let visitor accommodation since July 2022 (date may change). The purpose of this application is to demonstrate as described in Section 150 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 (as amended), ‘The Planning Act’, that the use of the flat as short term let visitor accommodation does not constitute development as no material change of use has taken place.
             1.1.3.	For booking purposes the flat is known as the ‘Bright and Stylish Apartment in the City Centre’. (City Centre’ may change) The flat is used for short term residential letting purposes, or as a ‘self-catering holiday let’, and has been used continuously for this purpose since before the confirmation of Edinburgh’s short term let control area.
             1.1.4.	The property is indicated on the Site Location plan and Floor Plan submitted in support of this Application.
             5.	Assessment
             5.1.1.	As Lord Justice Sullivan noted in his ruling, the Planning Authority is ‘entitled’ to form a view as to whether a material change of use has taken place; based on matters of fact and degree.
             5.1.2.	Turning to the subject property at Flat 6, 77 Cumberland Street, (address change here) as already noted, the 2021 Guidance document referred to in section 4 of this Planning Statement provides a useful list of relevant matters that will allow the fact and degree of any change from a residential use to a short term let use to be assessed.
             5.1.3.	To assist the Planning Authority in its assessment of these matters, the paragraphs that follow offers some consideration of the subject property when assessed against these matters.
             The character of the new use and of the wider area
             5.1.4.	The short term let use allows visitors to the city to stay temporarily in residential properties. Very often such stays are marketed as allowing visitors to ‘live like locals’. The emphasis of such use is on visitors behaving in such a way that they feel like they are permanent residents. In this way, guests that want to give most expression to the idea of living like a local will act and behave in a manner that is practically indistinguishable from that of a permanent resident.
             5.1.5.	In terms of the character of the wider area, the property is located in Edinburgh’s New Town (town info may change). This is an explicitly urban quarter of the city, expressly laid out as such in the late 18th century and early 19th Century. In such areas, acting reasonably, both permanent residents and visitors should recognise that an urban setting like this can absorb a relatively wide range of urban activities. These might include: people coming in and out of buildings at different times of day and night; people and vehicles moving along streets at different times of day and night; and, commercial activity taking place predominantly during the day.
             5.1.6.	The property at 77 Cumberland Street (address and measurement and town info change) is located less than 50 metres from a public house with a beer garden, and less than 200 metres from an area beginning on St Stephen’s Street designated in City of Edinburgh Council’s Adopted Local Development Plan 2016 as performing a ‘town centre’ function for Stockbridge.
             5.1.7.	Overall, the immediate area surrounding the property is considered to be relatively busy where some activity is reasonably to be expected. It is considered that for many people the ongoing activity that the area supports would be regarded as a benefit rather than as an adverse outcome; and compares favourably with perhaps the vast majority of places elsewhere in Scotland where such activity does not occur. The latent activity levels that this area enjoys also means that this is an area that has shown itself capable of assimilating a range of uses together in a host urban environment that does not appear to be fragile or adversely sensitive to change.
             The size of the property
             5.1.8.	(change bedroom and max people and measurement info) The property has one double-bedroom. It is advertised as capable of hosting a maximum of 3 people. The property extends to approximately 44 sqm. This is considerably smaller than the 52sqm minimum standard for a one-bedroom residential property identified by the City of Edinburgh Council in its January 2020 Design Guidance document. The reason stated in the document for defining these minimum space standards was ‘in order to ensure satisfactory amenity’.
             5.1.9.	(change bedroom and resident count and visitor info) For the avoidance of doubt, a one-bedroom property like this would be equally capable of hosting either 3 permanent residents (a couple and a child) or 3 visitors (a couple and a child).
             The pattern of activity associated with the use including numbers of occupants, the period of use, issues of noise, disturbance and parking demand
             5.1.10.	(change guest count info) As noted above, the maximum number of guests that could stay in the property would be 3. The applicant has confirmed that a minimum stay duration of (change amount of nights and month info) 2 nights is in place throughout most of the year, with this total rising to a 4 night minimum stay in August. The applicant advises that the property is used as a short term let an average of 9 nights per calendar month.
             5.1.11.	Each guest is vetted by the hosting company that looks after its servicing. Under its own procedures, the company ensures that no-one under the age of 25 is allowed to rent the property.
             5.1.12.	All guests are required to agree to ‘house rules’ for the property at the point of booking. These rules outlaw practices such as: smoking or vaping anywhere in the property; holding parties; and keeping pets. The guest book provided with the property for each group of guests explains these rules as well as providing further detail on matters such as refuse disposal and recycling; bag storage and nearby parking; and ‘quiet periods’ in the property (between 10pm and 7.30am) (hours may change).
             5.1.13.	To assist in assessing the property against this matter, a copy of the property’s guest book as well as a copy of the hosting company’s house rules have been appended to this application as supporting documents. Overall, it is considered that there is far greater control of guest behaviour and of all activity that can take place in the property than would be the case if it was let out to a permanent resident.
             The nature and character of any services provided
             5.1.14.	For those arriving by car, guests are directed to suggested local public car parks within the guest book provided with the property. For the avoidance of doubt, the lack of car parking is made clear on the property’s online listing. Anecdotally, the hosting company has confirmed that most guests in fact arrive by train or plane and do not require parking of any description.
             5.1.15.	The property has no access to any private or shared outside amenity garden areas. (storage rules may change here) It also has no bag storage facilities on site (although again, suggested commercial outlets where bag storage is available is detailed in the guest book).
             5.1.16.	All cleaning of the property takes place after check-out/departures (10.30 am) (times listed here may change) and before check-in/arrivals (4pm). Accordingly, the servicing of the property always takes place in office hours and not during anti- social times.

            1.1.4. The property is indicated on the Site Location plan and Floor Plan submitted in support of this Application.

            5.1.5. The property is located in North Berwick, a coastal town with access to beach and amenities within walking distance. This can absorb a relatively wide range of urban activities, including people and vehicles moving along streets at different times, and commercial activity.
            5.1.6. The property is less than 50 metres from Milsey Beach and less than 500 metres from shops and restaurants, contributing to its appeal as a 'live like a local' destination.
            5.1.7. The surrounding properties are a mix of residential and holiday lets, suggesting that this area is capable of assimilating a range of uses.
            The size of the property
            5.1.8. The property is advertised as capable of hosting a maximum of 4 people.

            1. Introduction
            1.1.1. Contour Town Planning has been tasked with drafting a planning statement in support of this application to the City of Edinburgh Council by Ruggero Baietta for a Certificate of Lawfulness of Existing Use or Development in relation to his property at a designated address.
            1.1.2. The property has been operating as short term let visitor accommodation since July 2022. The aim of this application is to demonstrate, under Section 150 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997, that the use of the property as short term let visitor accommodation has not triggered a material change of use.
            1.1.3. The property, labeled as the ‘Bright and Stylish Apartment’, is used for short term residential letting or as a 'self-catering holiday let'. It has been used without interruption for this purpose since prior to the introduction of Edinburgh’s short term let control area.
            1.1.4. The property location and layout are demonstrated on the Site Location plan and Floor Plan submitted alongside this Application.
            Assessment
            5.1.1. As noted by Lord Justice Sullivan, the Planning Authority can form an opinion on whether a material change of use has occurred, based on factual evidence and degree of change.
            5.1.2. Now focusing on the property located in the residential area near Medawbank shopping centre, the 2021 Guidance document referenced in section 4 of this Planning Statement gives a relevant list of factors to evaluate any potential change from residential use to a short term let use.
            5.1.3. The upcoming paragraphs present a comprehensive analysis of the property based on these factors.
            The character of the new use and of the wider area
            5.1.4. The short term let use provides an opportunity for tourists to temporarily reside in private properties, often enabling them to 'live like locals'. This encourages visitors to blend in as if they were permanent residents.
            5.1.5. Regarding the wider area, the property is located in Edinburgh's residential zone near Holyrood Palace. This part of the city, established in the late 18th century, can accommodate a wide spectrum of urban activities due to its urban design. These activities may include diverse pedestrian and vehicle traffic at different times, as well as commercial activities during the day.
            5.1.6. The property's location, less than 50 metres from a public house with a beer garden and less than 200 metres from the commercial area on St Stephen’s Street, contributes to the city of Edinburgh Council's Local Development Plan 2016 as a 'town centre' function for Stockbridge.
            5.1.7. The immediate surroundings of the property are fairly busy and some activity is expected. For many, the ongoing activity is seen as a benefit, as it compares favorably with most places in Scotland where such activity is absent. This area's latent activity levels also suggest it can assimilate a variety of uses without appearing fragile or sensitive to change.
            The size of the property
            5.1.8. The property comprises a double bedroom and a twin bedroom and can accommodate up to 4 people. The property measures approximately 44 sqm. This is notably smaller than the 52sqm minimum standard for a two-bedroom residential property defined by the City of Edinburgh Council in its January 2020 Design Guidance document, which aims to ensure satisfactory amenities.
            5.1.9. To clarify, a two-bedroom property like this could accommodate either 4 permanent residents or 4 visitors.
            The pattern of activity associated with the use including numbers of occupants, the period of use, issues of noise, disturbance and parking demand
            5.1.10. The maximum number of guests that the property can house is 4. The owner confirms a minimum stay duration of 2 nights in place throughout the year, with an average stay of about 5 days. The property is used as a short term let for an average of 9 nights per calendar month.
            5.1.11. Every guest is screened by the Airbnb host. The host's procedures ensure that no-one under the age of 25 is allowed to rent the property.
            5.1.12. All guests must agree to the property's house rules at the time of booking. These rules prohibit practices such as smoking, holding parties, and keeping pets. The guest book provided to each group of guests explains these rules in addition to details on refuse disposal, recycling, bag storage, nearby parking, and 'quiet periods' in the property.
            5.1.13. Copies of the property's guest book and the hosting company's house rules are attached to this application as supporting documents. It is considered that there is greater control over guest behavior and all activities within the property compared to a long-term lease.
            The nature and character of any services provided
            5.1.14. Car-arriving guests are directed to local public car parks in the guest book provided with the property. It's clear in the property's online listing that it does not offer parking. However, the majority of guests reportedly arrive by train or plane, negating the need for parking.
            5.1.15. The property doesn't have access to private or shared garden areas. It also lacks bag storage facilities on site. Information on commercial outlets offering bag storage is provided in the guest book.
            5.1.16. Cleaning of the property is done after check-out (10.30 am) and before check-in (4pm). Therefore, the servicing of the property occurs during office hours and not during antisocial times.

          Assessment
          5.1.1. In line with Lord Justice Sullivan's ruling, the Planning Authority holds the right to form a view based on matters of fact and degree. However, due to the absence of complete details, an accurate assessment cannot be made at this stage.
          5.1.2. Once detailed information about the subject property is available, an in-depth evaluation of the change in use, if any, from a residential use to a short-term let use can be carried out.
          5.1.3. The Planning Authority's evaluation process can be assisted once we have relevant details regarding the property, its use, and its surroundings.
          5.1.4. Without the specifics about the property's use, the character of the new use, and the wider area cannot be ascertained.
          5.1.5. In absence of the property details, we cannot comment on the character of the wider area.
          5.1.6. Details regarding the property's proximity to local amenities, attractions or establishments would assist in making a more informed assessment, however, such information is currently unavailable.
          5.1.7. Without details regarding the property and its surrounding area, we cannot provide an accurate assessment of the nature of the area or the property's impact on it.
          5.1.8. Until details about the property size, number of bedrooms, and potential occupancy are received, a precise assessment of the property's layout and its suitability for use cannot be made.
          5.1.9. The potential number of residents or visitors that the property could accommodate can only be estimated once the property details have been provided.
          5.1.10. Information about the property's usage pattern, including the number of occupants, period of use, noise, disturbance, and parking demand is currently unavailable.
          5.1.11. Details regarding guest screening procedures are not available at this point.
          5.1.12. We are awaiting details about house rules and property-specific practices that guests must adhere to.
          5.1.13. Without the necessary documentation or guidelines, an assessment of property's guest rules and their enforcement cannot be made.
          5.1.14. Details pertaining to parking facilities and related guidance for guests are currently unavailable.
          5.1.15. Information on outdoor spaces or storage facilities at the property is currently not available.
